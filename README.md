# Ecommerce Invoice Analysis
## :scroll: Summary

The objective of this project is to explore the invoice data of an ecommerce business in 2010-2011 to generate actionable insights for the business. A variety of SQL techniques such as window functions, CTEs, joins, subqueries are applied throughout this project. After cleaning and modelling the dataset using SQL, insights will be visualised into dashboard and summary report using Tableau. 

Lack of context is the biggest challenge for this project because there were not any types of data dictionary to explain the data contained in each field. Therefore, incorrect interpretations of data in this project are inevitable and open to feedback.
